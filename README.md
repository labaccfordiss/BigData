# WeComputer

To enable big data harnessing, this repository includes projects on big data compuwer system architecture configuration and data compression. 


BigDataCompression21>>
The big data can be compressed with spatiotemperal learning to extract only the cricital patterns for transmission, to save power consumption.


SpatialVariability21>>
The spatial variability of sensors can be leveraged to understand their similarity and difference, towards pertinent big data harnessing. 


SysConfigOptimize>>
The system of many sensors can be optimized with reinforcement leanring to optimally configure the architecture.


SysModeCharacterize>>
The relationships between different spatial sensors can be leveraged to characterize the system and manage system mode analysis.
